TITLE: Notes About the Command Pattern and this Example Implementation

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- This implementation is very simple, it provides an Undo option for commands but does not support macro commands 
- This implementation does not have a Command stack for chain undoing commands
- This implementation does use a 'NoneCommand' to simulate a NULL object
- Little error checking is used for validating command requests by the client, as this example is simply for demonstrating the pattern

PRIMARY USE(S) FOR THIS PATTERN:
- Useful to handle a series of commands or user inputs in one location
- Decouples an object so that a request can be handled by something that knows how to handle it 
- Going further, the Command objects themselves could simply implement functionality instead of delegating requests to a receiver

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS PATTERN:
- Potential explosion of concrete command classes
