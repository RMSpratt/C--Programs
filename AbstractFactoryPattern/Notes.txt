PRIMARY USE(S) FOR THIS PATTERN:
- Creating a family of products or class instances through a single interface without specifying their concrete classes
- The client can create all products through factories

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE OBSERVER PATTERN:
- Interface for creating product factories must be modified if new products are added
