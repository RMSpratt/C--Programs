TITLE: Notes About the Factory Method Pattern and this implementation

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- This version of the pattern is a parameterized version for creating multiple types of products from the factory

PRIMARY USE(S) FOR THIS PATTERN:
- Allows creator classes to be written without knowledge of the product to be created
- Decouples the implementation of some product or class from its use
- Supports the 'Dependency Inversion Principle' to rely on abstractions from a higher-level and a lower-level 
--> In this case, the concrete creator classes depend on the abstract Product, and the concrete Product subclasses rely 
    on the abstract Product class
