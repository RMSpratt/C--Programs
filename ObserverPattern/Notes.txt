TITLE: Notes About the Observer Pattern and this Implementation

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- This version of the Observer pattern makes use of C#'s built-in IObserver and IObservable interfaces
- This version of the Observer pattern expects a Class Object for the Subject

PRIMARY USE(S) FOR THIS PATTERN:
- Useful to have a multitude of class instances be aware of a shared subject 
- Allows the subject to not care about the observers' implementation 

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE OBSERVER PATTERN:
- Question of its value given its complexity, and considering other features exist (i.e. events)
- Observers generally should only be subscribed to a single subject in this pattern
- You must ensure that observers are properly de-registered when they are destroyed or no longer 
  interested in a particular subject
