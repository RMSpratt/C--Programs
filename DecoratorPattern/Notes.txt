TITLE: Notes About the Decorator Pattern and this Implementation

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- This implementation consists of a simple Component class hierarchy and a simple Decorator class hierarchy

PRIMARY USE(S) FOR THIS PATTERN:
- Useful to add functionality to some base class without modifying it 
- Prevents an explosion of sub-classes from a base class
- Can be used in conjunction with the Factory pattern 

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS PATTERN:
- This pattern may break code dependent on a concrete type 
- This pattern isn't designed to know what other decorators have wrapped a given component
